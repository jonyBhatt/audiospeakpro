**Audio Speak Pro**

### **Project Overview**

**Audio Speak Pro** is a web application designed to provide free text-to-speech functionality to users who may not have access to paid alternatives. The app leverages the capabilities of Hugging Face's API to convert text into audio.

### **System Architecture**

The system architecture for Audio Speak Pro is relatively straightforward:

1. **Frontend (Next.js):** Handles user interactions, including text input and audio playback.
2. **Backend (API Gateway):** Acts as an intermediary between the frontend and the Hugging Face API.
3. **Hugging Face API:** Provides the text-to-speech functionality.
4. **MongoDB Database:** (Optional) Can be used to store user preferences or usage data.

### **Key Technologies**

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js (for API Gateway)
- **Database:** MongoDB (optional)
- **Text-to-Speech API:** Hugging Face

### **Data Flow**

1. The user enters text into the frontend.
2. The frontend sends the text to the backend API.
3. The backend API forwards the text to the Hugging Face API.
4. The Hugging Face API processes the text and returns an audio file.
5. The backend API sends the audio file back to the frontend.
6. The frontend plays the audio for the user.

### **Code Structure**

**Frontend (Next.js):**

- **Components:**
  - `TextInput`: Handles user input.
  - `AudioPlayer`: Handles audio playback.
  - `App`: Main component, coordinating the other components.
- **Pages:**
  - `page.tsx`: Main page of the application.

**Backend (Node.js):**

- **Routes:**
  - `/api/text-to-speech`: Handles text-to-speech requests.
- **Controllers:**
  - `textToSpeechController.ts`: Contains the logic for interacting with the Hugging Face API.

### **API Integration**

- Use the Hugging Face API documentation to understand how to make requests and handle responses.
- Authenticate with the API using your Hugging Face API key.
- Implement error handling to gracefully handle potential API failures.
